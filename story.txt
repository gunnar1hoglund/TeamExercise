Flughafen is right behind my backyard. And I see kopfkino everyday

Schneewittchen like to eat bratwurst in Biergarten

We all went down into the Ratskeller, dressed in our dirndel. 

I hopped in my BMW excited to hit the Biergarten. 

After a few drinks I thought I could finish 25 Bratwurst, but that was just a Schnapsidee.

I get really wettbewerbsfaehig when it comes to drinking games, which is how the night got so crazy!

My maanlage broke then i went down the Hauptstrasse and saw a Luftschloss.
